ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Mendoza
# About Me
I like to research and expand my knowledge. I adapt quickly to new environments and tasks. Currently, I am developing my skills as a Front End web developer with knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Git. I have a basic understanding of these topics, and I have an intermediate-high level of English. My goal is to create functional, attractive and accessible websites for different types of users. I constantly seek to learn new technologies and tools that allow me to improve my professional performance. I continue to perfect my skills to be able to apply them.
